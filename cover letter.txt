I have already finished a course in QA manual testing. In the course, I received the relevant knowledge, and now I want to develop further and gain practical experience in this area. I have experience working with educational projects and testing some commercial sites. Still, I'm already looking forward to when I can work and perform interesting and important tasks in the testing process.
I believe that possessing such essential qualities as responsibility, dedication, diligence, and perseverance will help me successfully prove myself in my work.
I have always been interested in technology and this area, in particular, I have long wanted to have the opportunity to work with what I like and be helpful, as well as to become a good specialist in this field. 
Regards, Anastasia.
I'm a super worker, pay me more money.
